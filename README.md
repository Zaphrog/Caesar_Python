# Caesar_Python
Caesar is a very simple and popular encryption method: You pick a number and add it to the number equivalent of each letter. For example: hello (8, 5, 12, 12, 15) encrypted with 5 would be MJQQT (13, 9, 18, 18, 20). If the number after the encryption exceeds the range of 26, you just do n - 26. In the first code you can encrypt and decrypt the message, but the encryption already knows the encryption value. So i added a second code with which you can decrypt the message without knowing the encryption value. There is a list with the most used letters in the english, spanish and german alphabets. You choose the language. In a longer message, it is almost 100% sure that the most used character would be ' ' (spacebar), so it will assume that the character most used in the encrypted message is spacebar and will calculate the encryption value. There are other settings, so you can encrypt shorter messages after a few attempts. It changes settings just by pressing "ENCRYPT" again.
